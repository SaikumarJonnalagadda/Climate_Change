##  Overview
Climate Chatbot is an innovative application designed to engage users in meaningful conversations about climate change. Unlike traditional chatbots that provide answers to user queries, Climate Chatbot takes a unique approach by solely asking questions related to climate change. By posing thought-provoking questions, the chatbot aims to stimulate discussions, raise awareness, and encourage users to explore the complexities of climate change.
